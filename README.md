## Features

### Back End

#### Database

## Front End

#### Demo Log In
- Added button for quick and easy viewing without needing to set up an account or remember credentials
#### Map
- Google Maps will show participating locations, incorporated in the Search function discussed below
#### Search
- Four layer search: First layer will automatically show only restaurants within zoom level of the map, as is the case on MealPal. The second through fourth layers are where I believe I made a minor improvement to the actual search. On MealPal, you may type a restaurant name, select your cuisine types and portion size and then click "apply" to run the search. On StealPal, it will respond to each click and narrow or expand your options accordingly, just as it does with the map.
#### Reservations
- You can place and cancel meal reservations
## Room for Improvement

### CSS
- This is a work in progress, attempting to recapture the look and feel of the original site.
