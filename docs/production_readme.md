## Features

### Back End
#### AUTH
-  sign up, sign in
#### Database
- Saves Restaurants and their collection of meals
#### Meal options

## Front End

#### Demo Log In
- Added button for quick and easy viewing
#### Map
- Google Maps will show participating locations
#### Search
- Four layer search: First layer will automatically show only restaurants within zoom level of the map, as is the case on MealPal. The second through fourth layers are where I believe I made a minor improvement to the actual search. On MealPal, you may type a restaurant name, select your cuisine types and portion size and then click "apply" to run the search. On StealPal, it will respond to each click and narrow or expand your options accordingly, just as it does with the map.
#### Reservations
- You can place a meal reservation

## Room for Improvement
- There are quite a few issues to be addressed
### CSS
- This obviously needs a good amount of work
### Fixing Bugs
- Fix issues with reservations
- Add more seeds
- Fix a couple broken buttons
